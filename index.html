            <H1>About</H1>
            <p>I consider myself an outdoorman with a goal of going places that most people wouldn't think of going.
                Whether I am driving or hiking I love to push the limits of my skills.</p>
            <p>As a hobby I have taught myself to build 4WD trucks. After my early years of buiding Jeeps I have moved
                to be specialized in the Toyota Land Cruiser platform. In my opinion it covers all requirements of
                offroad travel. </p>
            <p>Lately I have been joined on my adventures with my dog "Slippery Pete". He's an Australian Cattle Dog who
                shares the same love for the outdoors. If you have a ball or frisbee he will be your best friend.
            </p>
            <p>When not building and driving 4WDs I have enjoyed learning to farm. Over the last few years my family and
                I have raised all our own meat. Chicken, pork, and beef.</p>
            <p>I am a big believer in never stop learning. This mindset is fundamental to my work ethic. In every job I
                take on I try to excel, either by finding a mentor for guidience or figuring out solutions for problems
                on my own. I take pride in finding jobs others aren't willing to do and making them my own.</p>
